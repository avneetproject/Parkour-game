# Parkour-game

Welcome! 👋  
This repository documents the early development of a **parkour-focused third-person game** built in **Unreal Engine 5.5**, with a strong emphasis on **animation systems, motion matching, and traversal flow**.

This project serves as a **technical gameplay and animation showcase**, exploring modern character movement pipelines in UE5.

## 🚀 Current Development Status

### Animation & Movement Systems
- Motion Matching–based locomotion setup for responsive traversal
- Initial **vault** and **jump** animations implemented and validated in gameplay
- Animation sampling and testing across **multiple character models** to ensure retargeting compatibility

### Level Design
- Early-stage level design focused on parkour flow, spacing, and traversal readability
- Blockout environments created to test movement timing, animation transitions, and player momentum

### Technical Focus
- Evaluation of animation blending, pose selection, and responsiveness
- Iterative testing of traversal mechanics under different character proportions and rigs

---

## 🧪 Work in Progress

- Additional traversal actions (climb, slide, wall interactions)
- Expanded level layouts for complex parkour routes
- Animation polish and motion database refinement

---

## ⚠️ Status

Active development — systems and content are evolving rapidly.  
Expect incomplete features, experimental setups, and frequent iteration.

This repository reflects an **animation-first gameplay development approach** in Unreal Engine 5.5.

This repository exists to showcase my progress building a Parkour game in Unreal Engine 5.5. It serves as a running log of experiments, iterations, and improvements as I learn and implement core gameplay systems.

### What you’ll find here
- Work-in-progress game builds and prototypes
- New features as they’re developed (mechanics, UI, levels, etc.)
- Refactors and fixes as the project evolves

### Status
Active development — expect frequent changes and unfinished content.

### Notes
This is primarily a personal progress repository, so things may change quickly or break between commits.
